# README

This is a place to experiment with using Rails and React together as facilitated by the `react_on_rails` gem.

Setup is the same as for the `react_on_rails` tutorial that can be found at https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md#setting-up-the-environment

I learned about the React implementation of the memory game in https://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/details/ebooks/Reactjs_Succinctly
